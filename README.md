Project for the course Socialgraphs.

The aim of this project is to find out who is the main character in Game of Thrones. This is done by using multiple methods and datasources, such as links, sentiment and co-occurrences based on the Game of Thrones Fandom, the transcript of the series as well as annotated episodes from the TV show.
The [explainer notebook](notebooks/explainer_notebook.ipynb) gives an overview of how the charts are created for the report.
